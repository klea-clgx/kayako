{"text":"Hello Reporting, Service 1st has been receiving a report called \u201cService_1st_-_Billing\u201d. They are looking for a change to the report for the Vendor Fee column. For each AVM order, the Vendor fee is listed at $25, but it should be either $0, because there is no actual vendor on the order, or $15, because this is what they will be paying to Mercury as the tech fee. Can you advise where this value is being sourced from so that it can be updated, or are you able to update the report to more accurately reflect the Vendor Fee?
